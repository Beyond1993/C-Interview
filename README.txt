Step1 :$ make 
Step2 :$ ./murmur

Marks:

At first, I was confused by the requirement:
"Provide an apply() member function of the class which takes a lambda function 
  that returns a tuple of the key values that the class will use to get the murmur3 hashing."

There are two way of understanding:

1: take the lambda function as the parameter of the apply() function.
2: create a lambda function inside the apply() function.

The first one is selected in this test.

I really cherish this interview opportunity, Thank you so much!
